           ,N'As a child I always lusted after the Armatron robotic arm. Oh, the amazing things I would have done! I could have assembled miniature cars! Pinched my sister remotely! Gently squashed bugs to paste! But, alas, the Armatron was too expensive and I never got one.
Now that I’m old and wizened I can finally get one. Or at least something like it.
The Swift by UFactory is a crowdfunded robotic arm that promises fun, frolic and programmable robotic interaction for about $300 for early-bird models. There are two versions — the standard Swift with a louder DC model and the Pro unit with a more accurate stepper motor — and they can be used to perform tricks like laser etching, light painting and simple assembly. It’s programmable using UFactory’s Scratch-like programming language and you can even move the arm manually and it will recreate your motions.
They plan on shipping in May and the UFactory and their UArm team have already shipped more complex arms that have been used to open potato chip bags and, inexplicably, tickle a poop emoji.
The most complete package costs $499 and includes a gripper, laser and 3D printer head. While all of this looks too good to be true — and since it’s a crowdfunding campaign the buyer should beware — darn it if this doesn’t tickle that little nugget in my brain that always wanted a robot friend. Armatron, you’re dead to me.'

           ,'Facebook is rolling out a useful new feature that puts a full weather forecast inside its mobile app and desktop site. '
           ,N'Facebook is rolling out a useful new feature that puts a full weather forecast inside its mobile app and desktop site. The feature is accessible from News Feed or the mobile app’s “More” menu — the section that links you to areas like Friends, Events, Groups, Pages and other key Facebook features like On This Day or Saved items. Within the Weather section, you can view a full forecast for your week ahead, powered by data from Weather.com.
Facebook confirmed that the new feature, an updated version of its earlier “weather greetings,” has launched to around 95 percent of its global population as of this week.
This is not the first time Facebook has toyed with introducing weather information into its service. The company years ago added forecasts to events and public places, and more recently was spotted testing weather updates in its News Feed in the U.K.'

		   ,'How startups thrive in emerging markets'
           ,N'“What is happening in Turkey?” is not a question you want to hear from friends and family abroad when you are trying to scale a business or raise funding for your startup.

           ,N'“What is happening in Turkey?” is not a question you want to hear from friends and family abroad when you are trying to scale a business or raise funding for your startup.
Having to explain the intricacies of your geography (in addition to your own value proposition) is also not the position you want to be in when you’re launching a VC fund.
Plagued by terror attacks and distracted by volatility from within and by neighboring civil issues, Turkey has made quite a few headlines recently. These have been happening to a country that was once regarded the beacon of hope as a secular, democratic, Muslim country in the Middle East.
The consecutive hands Turkey recently got dealt have pushed the country’s “normal” to an unnerving state. Two days after the coup attempt, I remember getting a text from Dave. He first asked whether I was OK and secondly what I planned to do with 500 Istanbul, a $15 million early-stage micro VC fund we had launched only a couple of months prior.
I told him there were no changes in the plans and that we would move forward. We did our first close for 500 Istanbul one week after, on the 22nd of July. While people were emailing me to make sure our families were OK, I was emailing out capital call notes. It is easy to look at Turkey as an outsider and come to certain conclusions, but as a local investor, I want to think there is still upside to be garnered from a region so big, so young and so hungry for VC capital and infrastructure.
What our emerging region lacks in predictability, it makes up in growth potential as an under-served landscape with serious funding gaps. What I wanted to undertake in this market is NOT a social impact mission.
Yes, our capital and services are needed now more than ever, but at the same time, our relative opportunity could be no greater, given the lack of investing competition in the market. The fact that the few existing institutional VCs in Turkey mostly focus on later-stage funding opens up an incredible market opportunity for early-stage investors.
This might be partly because of the preferences of the VCs investing in emerging markets, in trying to limit operational downside. As they feel they might already be exposed to a higher level of risk due to the volatilities of the region in which they operate, they often choose to invest in later-stage startups with a more mature track record. This is where 500 Istanbul comes in, to fill (albeit partially) the early-stage funding gap.'

           ,'Feeling in the mood to do a little remixing of classic pieces of art? You’re in luck: The Metropolitan Museum of Art has just made hundreds of thousands of pieces available under the Creative Commons Zero license, meaning they can be used pretty much however you see fit.'
           ,N'Feeling in the mood to do a little remixing of classic pieces of art? You’re in luck: The Metropolitan Museum of Art has just made hundreds of thousands of pieces available under the Creative Commons Zero license, meaning they can be used pretty much however you see fit.
The collection is basically any digitally catalogued piece that curators have determined is in the public domain. So really these were already out of copyright, but that doesn’t always mean they’re available in high quality and use in whatever circumstance officially sanctioned. Just look for the “Public Domain” and CC0 logo below whatever piece you’re thinking of using.
domainOr just browse through all public domain items here — warning, there are lots. If you’re unsure where to start, The Met helpfully offers a selection of categories to browse that it obviously felt would be attractive to the internet at large:
In addition to the license change, the museum has also collected metadata for its digitized collection under this GitHub account. And they announced partnerships with Creative Commons, Wikimedia, Pinterest and others (details to follow, apparently).
The Met, like many other museums, libraries and institutions of learning, has been pushing to make its collection available online to as many people as possible. It can be a surprising amount of work putting large collections up in any kind of ordered way, though, so don’t be mad if your favorite institution hasn’t done so yet.'

           ,N'Until October, John Podesta was most known as a diehard Democratic campaigner who worked in the White House under Bill Clinton and served as the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
But after WikiLeaks began publishing a trove of Podesta’s emails in the final month before the 2016 election, Podesta became perhaps the most widely recognized victim of hacking. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia stole Podesta’s emails — which contained everything from his risotto recipe to transcripts of Clinton’s private Wall Street speeches — and leaked them in an effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump.
Podesta reflected on the hack and its aftermath at the NewCo Shift Forum today, along with Shawn Henry, the president of the cybersecurity firm that investigated the DNC hacks, and Marc Elias, an attorney who worked as general counsel to the Clinton campaign. Podesta called out the FBI and WikiLeaks for damaging the campaign and issued a warning to tech and the media about the rise of fake news.'

		   ,'Intel inexplicably makes jobs announcement in round room with very nice curtains'
           ,'Intel’s latest press conference was its most well-appointed yet. The chipmaker’s CEO Brian Krzanich announced his company’s newest initiative in a tasteful if traditional space with lavish gold curtains and a stately desk.'
           ,N'Intel’s latest press conference was its most well-appointed yet. The chipmaker’s CEO Brian Krzanich announced his company’s newest initiative in a tasteful if traditional space with lavish gold curtains and a stately desk. The room, with notably rounded corners, was nearly 3,000 miles away from the company’s headquarters and many of its manufacturing sites.
In lieu of PR a representative, Krzanich, the CEO of the “great, great” company, was introduced by a forcefully spoken if not particularly eloquent man who was seated nearby.
“Brian called a few weeks ago and said we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but having to do mostly with Arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced,” the man said, as camera shutters snapped wildly a few feet away.
Krzanich heralded a $7 billion investment in Fab 42, the name of the semiconductor fabrication site in Chandler, Arizona that has been sitting idle after plans for it were abandoned in 2014. Fab 42 was first announced in 2011 and Intel claims that in the future it will employ 3,000 workers toward its manufacturing efforts. Notably, Intel cut 12,000 jobs — 11 percent of its workforce — in layoffs that began last May and are projected to be complete by mid-2017.
“Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S.,” Krzanich said.'
