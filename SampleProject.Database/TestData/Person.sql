		   ,'Steve Wozniak'
           ,'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Steve_Wozniak.jpg/220px-Steve_Wozniak.jpg'
           ,N'Stephen (or Stephan) Gary "Steve" Wozniak (/ˈwɒzniæk/, born August 11, 1950),[5] nicknamed "Woz", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc.'
           ,N'In 1969, Wozniak returned to the Bay Area after being expelled from University of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking into the institution''s computer system.[11][12] He later re-enrolled at De Anza College and transferred to University of California, Berkeley in 1971. Before focusing his attention on Apple, he was employed at Hewlett-Packard where he designed calculators.[13] It was during this time that he befriended Steve Jobs.
Steve Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by friend Bill Fernandez, who attended Homestead High School with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where Wozniak too was employed, working on a mainframe computer.[14] This was recounted by Wozniak in a 2007 interview with ABC News, of how and when he first met Steve Jobs:
    "We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A friend said, ''you should meet Steve Jobs, because he likes electronics and he also plays pranks.'' So he introduced us."[15]
In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California.[16] He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the brick representation. Too complex to be fully comprehended at the time, the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz''s prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak''s share was thus $350.[17] Wozniak did not learn about the actual $5,000 bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.
On June 29, 1975 Wozniak tested his first working prototype, displaying a few letters and running sample programs. It was the first time in history that a character displayed on a TV screen was generated by a home computer.[1] With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The Club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.[18]

In 1976, Wozniak developed the computer that eventually made him famous. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the Apple I.[18] Jobs had the idea to sell the Apple I as a fully assembled printed circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak''s HP scientific calculator and Jobs'' Volkswagen van), raised $1,300, and assembled the first boards in Jobs'' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs'' garage. Wozniak''s apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and "I came up with [it] because I like repeating digits.") Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 50 system boards to Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California.[1]'),

           ,N'John D. Carmack (born August 20, 1970) is an American game programmer, aerospace and virtual reality engineer. He co-founded id Software. Carmack was the lead programmer of the id video games Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake, Rage and their sequels.'
           ,N'Carmack, son of local television news reporter Stan Carmack, grew up in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area where he became interested in computers at an early age. He attended Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village, Kansas and Raytown South High School in nearby Raytown, Missouri.

As reported in David Kushner''s Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, he broke into a school to help a group of kids steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. John was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions ''no empathy for other human beings'' and describes Carmack as ''a brain on legs''). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.[3][4]

He attended the University of Missouri–Kansas City for two semesters before withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer.
Career

Softdisk, a computer company in Shreveport, Louisiana, hired Carmack to work on Softdisk G-S (an Apple IIGS publication), introducing him to John Romero and other future key members of id Software such as Adrian Carmack (not related). Later, this team would be placed by Softdisk in charge of a new, but short-lived, bi-monthly game subscription product called Gamer''s Edge for the IBM PC (DOS) platform. In 1990, while still at Softdisk, Carmack, Romero, and others created the first of the Commander Keen games, a series that was published by Apogee Software, under the shareware distribution model, from 1991 onwards. Afterwards, Carmack left Softdisk to co-found id Software.

Carmack has pioneered or popularized the use of many techniques in computer graphics, including "adaptive tile refresh" for Commander Keen, raycasting for Hovertank 3-D, Catacomb 3-D, and Wolfenstein 3-D, binary space partitioning which Doom became the first game to use, surface caching which he invented for Quake, Carmack''s Reverse (formally known as z-fail stencil shadows) which he devised for Doom 3, and MegaTexture technology, first used in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.

Carmack''s engines have also been licensed for use in other influential first-person shooters such as Half-Life, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor. In 2007, when Carmack was on vacation with his wife, he ended up playing some games on his cellphone, and decided he was going to make a "good" mobile game.[5][6]

On August 7, 2013, Carmack joined Oculus VR as their CTO. On November 22, 2013, he resigned from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR.[1][7] Carmack''s reason for leaving was because id''s parent company ZeniMax Media didn''t want to support Oculus Rift.[8] Carmack''s role at both companies later became central to a ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus parent company Facebook, claiming that Oculus stole ZeniMax''s virtual reality intellectual property.[9] The trial jury absolved Carmack of liability, though Oculus and other corporate officers were held liable for trademark, copyright, and contract violations.[10]'),

           ,'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/220px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg'
           ,N'Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage''s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.'
           ,N'Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[45] and mesmerism.[46] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a calculus of the nervous system").[47] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her ''potential'' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.[48] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.[49] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning "certain productions" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.[50]

Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his Difference Engine.[51] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace''s intellect and analytic skills. He called her "The Enchantress of Number".[52][note 1] In 1843 he wrote of her:

    Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.[52]

During a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea''s article on Babbage''s newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[53] Explaining the Analytical Engine''s function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.[54] Lovelace''s notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[55] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[56]

The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Section G[57]), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, which could have run correctly[citation needed] had the Analytical Engine been built (only his Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002[58]). Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered the first computer programmer[1] and her method is recognised as the world''s first computer program.[59]

Section G also contains Lovelace''s dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".[60]

Lovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement (a criticism of the government''s treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface—which would imply that she had written that also. When Taylor''s Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: "His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada''s involvement, and so happily indulged her ... because of her ''celebrated name''."[61] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher''s Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.[56]'),

		   ,'Linus Torvalds'
           ,'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Linus_Torvalds.jpeg/220px-Linus_Torvalds.jpeg'
           ,N'Linus Benedict Torvalds (/ˈlaɪnəsˈtɔːrvɔːldz/; Swedish: [ˈliːn.ɵs ˈtuːr.valds]; born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and, for a long time, principal developer, of the Linux kernel'
           ,N'The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later that year (1991).[10][23] Version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994.[24]

Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student Lars Wirzenius took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software-guru Richard Stallman''s speech. Torvalds used Stallman''s General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel.

After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996,[4] Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon,[1] to be closer to the OSDL''s Beaverton, Oregon-based headquarters.

From 1997 to 1999, he was involved in 86open helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. In 1999, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world''s top 100 innovators under age 35.[25]

In 1999, Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with stock options in gratitude for his creation.[26] That same year both companies went public and Torvalds''s share value temporarily shot up to roughly US$20 million.[27][28]

His personal mascot is a penguin nicknamed Tux,[29] which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the mascot of the Linux kernel.[30]

Although Torvalds believes "open source is the only right way to do software", he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job", even if that includes proprietary software.[31] He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel. Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called git.

In 2008, Torvalds stated that he used the Fedora distribution of Linux because it had fairly good support for the PowerPC processor architecture, which he had favored at the time.[32] His usage of Fedora was confirmed in a later 2012 interview.[33] He has also posted updates about his choice of desktop environment, often in response to perceived feature regressions.

Currently, the Linux Foundation sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux.[34]

Linus Torvalds is known for disagreeing with other developers on the Linux kernel mailing list.[35] Calling himself a "really unpleasant person", he later explained "I’d like to be a nice person and curse less and encourage people to grow rather than telling them they are idiots. I’m sorry – I tried, it’s just not in me."[36][37] His attitude, which Torvalds considers necessary for making his point clear, has drawn criticism from Intel programmer Sarah Sharp and systemd developer Lennart Poettering, among others.[38][39]'),

		   ,'John Romero'
           ,'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_(6951215353)_(cropped).jpg'
           ,N'Alfonso John Romero (born October 28, 1967) is an American director, designer, programmer, and developer in the video game industry. He is best known as a co-founder of id Software and designer for many of their games, including Wolfenstein 3D, Dangerous Dave, Hexen, Doom and Quake.'
           ,N'Romero moved to Shreveport, Louisiana in March 1989 and joined Softdisk as a programmer in its Special Projects division. After several months of helping the PC monthly disk magazine Big Blue Disk, he officially moved into the department until he started a PC games division in July 1990 named ''Gamer''s Edge'' (originally titled PCRcade). Romero hired John D. Carmack into the department from his freelancing in Kansas City, moved Adrian Carmack into the division from Softdisk''s art department, and persuaded Tom Hall to come in at night and help with game design. Romero and the others then left Softdisk in February 1991 to form id Software.

You''re not doing your work! You''re not living up to your responsibilities. You''re hurting the project. You''re hurting the company. You''ve been poisonous to the company, and your contribution has been negative over the past couple years. You needed to do better but you didn''t. Now you need to go! Here''s a resignation and here''s a termination! You''re going to resign now!
John Carmack to Romero on the day of his termination on August 6, 1996

Romero worked at id Software from its incorporation in 1991 until 1996. He was involved in the creation of several milestone games, including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth and Quake. He served as executive producer (and game designer) on Heretic and Hexen. He designed most of the first episode of Doom, most of the levels in Quake, half the levels in the Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny. He wrote many of the tools used at id Software to create their games, including DoomEd (level editor), QuakeEd (level editor), DM (for deathmatch launching), DWANGO client (to connect the game to DWANGO''s servers), TED5 (level editor for the Commander Keen series, Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny), IGRAB (for grabbing assets and putting them in WAD files), the installers for all the games up to and including Quake, the SETUP program used to configure the games, and several others.

During the production of Quake Romero clashed with John Carmack over the future direction of id. Romero wanted the game to follow his demanding vision without compromise, but Carmack insisted that the project had to make steady progress toward completion and accused Romero of not working as much as the other developers. Although Romero relented on his vision and joined a months-long death march effort to finish the game, this did not resolve the tensions within the company, and Romero was forced to resign.')
